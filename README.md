# McDonaldsProductChallenge-using-HTLM-CSS


A web challenge using HTML/CSS by @AbelMurgas for a community with the aim of generating more developers in the area of web development in Panama

## Rules

## McDonalds Product Challenge
You need to create a card product equal to the [Mcdonalds Website](https://www.mcdonalds.com.pa/)
<br>
*you can choose the font style and sizes, I recommend to visit the website and find the most similar fonts.*

### HTML-CSS
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css)](https://skillicons.dev)

Remember the good practice and center the parent div in the DOM.
<br>
*DO NOT USE CSS FRAME-WORK*

### React
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,react)](https://skillicons.dev)

The difference is that you need to create a project (named my-project) and get the information by passing data to the component (using props),
and you can create more than one product card.

Use your imagination and good luck :)
